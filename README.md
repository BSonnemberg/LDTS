## LDTS_2LEIC08 GR03 - DUSK

Our game is a text-based version of the DUSK '82 game. The main charachter is "The Intruder" whose objective is to open the door, throughout 4 different levels.
For the player to win the game, it needs to achive the key to open the door and then go to the door.
During this path, The Intruder may have attention to the goates and the remaining steps.
To gain steps the main charachter has to collect blue points.

This project was developed by Marta Costa (up202207879@fe.up.pt), Beatriz Sonnemberg (up202206098@fe.up.pt) and Luís Cordeiro (up202205425@fe.up.pt) for LDTS 2023⁄24.
